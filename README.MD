## Multivariate optimization library

See each sub-directory for different optimization approaches.

- A few metaheuristics algorithm have been implemented
- Stochastic gradient descent using my enhanced KANN library

PracticalExamples folder contains example of:

- Combine mathematical programming and metaheuristics to design of parametric IIR filters
