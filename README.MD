## Multivariate optimization library

See each sub-directory for different optimization approaches.

- A few metaheuristics algorithm have been implemented
- Reverse mode AD using my enhanced KANN library

PracticalExamples folder contains example of:

- Combine mathematical programming and metaheuristics to design of parametric IIR filters

A example of optimization history of peaking fit(Graph animation is mainly contribute by gradient-based method, as long as metaheuristics doesn't harm the solution and reduce cost):
